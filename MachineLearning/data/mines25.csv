16228398,2021-10-04T18:56:08.000Z,1.4451E+18,Oklahoma released their updated data. 645 hospitalizations out of 1.8m vaccinated.  And there were .5% Breakthrough cases (vaccinated)  vs 1% reinfections (had covid already).  Both are rising.  https://t.co/HccIDNDgQc https://t.co/UsWbmOcsgh,44,560,142,4
16228398,2021-10-04T17:00:47.000Z,1.44507E+18,173m adults (67%) are fully vaxxed and 215m 12+ (75.5%) have at least 1 shot. The % is even higher in urban areas. I'm guessing in NY and LA its really smart business to entice the vaccinated who probably care more about safety to come to your retail business. #SilentMajority https://t.co/4Ioml0ku43,76,1348,258,15

16228398,2021-10-04T16:06:30.000Z,1.44506E+18,Yes Cole they can get it from a vaccinated person. But there are hundreds of millions of vaccinated people they can't catch it from because those people got vaccinated and didn't catch covid. That Cole is the entire point.

16228398,2021-10-04T16:00:44.000Z,1.44506E+18,So it is 100% your decision to make just as it is 100% the decision of business owners to determine how they want to access the risks Covid brings to their businesses and set the guidelines they think work best.,189,3362,303,50
16228398,2021-10-04T16:00:43.000Z,1.44506E+18,Then just say that. When they say its 95% effective that means some can get it and those that catch it can transmit it.

Like immunity from shots. But I have to ask are you suggesting that going forward people try to catch covid again rather than getting vaccinated? https://t.co/V0oyE9TKJP,60,1575,269,22
16228398,2021-09-30T23:36:31.000Z,1.44372E+18,But to give you actual numbers 16k vaxxed 15762 didn't catch it.  natural immunity 15981 didn't catch it. But again both wane. Only ways to definitively extend that immunity is to be DAF and try to catch it again or get the shot. The shot wins every time,38,961,301,13
16228398,2021-09-30T23:36:30.000Z,1.44372E+18,That is not what it says. Nor is that the goal. You should read the study. It said those infected with a shot faired best.

16228398,2021-09-30T23:15:47.000Z,1.44372E+18,And what did that study say people who had covid should do ? And where is the study that determines how long that natural immunity lasts ?

16228398,2021-09-16T18:05:07.000Z,1.43856E+18,5.  Personally I think regulation built around existing fraud laws is not a bad thing.  It will require Proof of Authorship and identity but it won?€?t hurt innovation  nor slow anything down. It will open the door for more people to confidently use ?€?crypto?€?.  Thoughts ?,45,609,279,25
16228398,2021-09-16T18:05:05.000Z,1.43856E+18,4. If you require Proof of Authorship for Smart Contracts and Tokenomics  the feds and victims will have a person/entity to sue or indict.  Probably at the cost of anonymous innovators but that?€?s the price that will be paid.,30,366,36,11
16228398,2021-09-16T18:05:04.000Z,1.43856E+18,3. Tokenomics are confusing and a ripe opportunity for fraud. How treasury is used. How tokens are sold and distributed.  What liquidity is put in place and what information is disclosed and how accurate it is.  Like SCs there will need to be Proof of Authorship and Identity,26,289,27,10
16228398,2021-09-16T18:05:02.000Z,1.43856E+18,2A. Which in turn means that the feds will not allow for anonymous SCs. Someone will need to take responsibility or it will be deemed illegal which may prevent off shore contracts from being legal if they don?€?t register. Proof of Authorship and Identity could be a thing,32,364,80,50
16228398,2021-09-16T18:05:01.000Z,1.43856E+18,2. Smart Contracts are the most likely source of fraud.Intentional omissions undisclosed actions lack of clarity by users. I don?€?t think SCs will need to be approved first. I think they will be reported for fraud and will need certified audits to prove lack of fraudulent intent,35,426,35,23
16228398,2021-09-16T18:05:00.000Z,1.43856E+18,1. Stablecoins will be the first to get regulated. Why? The variance in the definition by product. What is a peg? What is an algorithmic stablecoin ? Is it stable? Do buyers understand what the risks are? It needs standards,33,504,36,16
16228398,2021-09-16T18:04:58.000Z,1.43856E+18,Any discussion of crypto regulation has to start with the facts that there are already laws against fraud and  that ?€?crypto?€? is not monolithic.

16228398,2021-09-16T01:53:46.000Z,1.43832E+18,Colon cancer is a preventable disease.  It just takes getting a colonoscopy early enough.. I think most people are afraid of doing it. If you are please consider this option. It was truly easy and fast. And again talk to your doctor first. A colonoscopy can save your life !,87,1142,69,7
16228398,2021-09-16T01:51:48.000Z,1.43832E+18,I have to add that not all insurers cover this and $600 isn?€?t cheap but you may be able to get it cheaper If you can make it work and  your Dr approves it was fast and easy and w no meds I drove myself and was back to work immediately. And again talk to your Doc about it first,12,221,26,0
16228398,2021-09-16T01:51:48.000Z,1.43832E+18,To those afraid of getting your 1st colonoscopy I recommend getting a CT Colonoscopy. You still prep the same but the process took 30 mins. It felt weird but didn?€?t hurt and cost $600. No meds at all. Talk to your Dr of course but this approach was EASY https://t.co/bnLqysmptv,164,1748,264,55

12,2021-10-15T20:29:41.000Z,1.44911E+18,5/Mining isn?€?t accessible to everyone. Bitcoin mining should be as easy as plugging a rig into a power source. There isn?€?t enough incentive today for individuals to overcome the complexity of running a miner for themselves. What are the biggest barriers for people running miners?,300,4117,427,66
12,2021-10-15T20:29:40.000Z,1.44911E+18,4/There isn?€?t enough focus on vertical integration.

138203134,2021-11-08T01:02:39.000Z,1.45751E+18,One dangerous aspect of thinking there?€?s a ?€?woke problem?€? is that Dem chances for re-election or majorities in House Senate &amp; WH rely on the racial justice issue of voting rights.Dems distancing from racial justice makes protection of voting rights less likelyensuring losses,4550,33634,3486,677
138203134,2021-11-07T21:17:50.000Z,1.45746E+18,We can and should message BIF as a step but messaging it as a solution alone is going to get us into trouble.BBB contains the majority of the presidents agenda. We must keep going and ensure the promises are delivered,1161,10267,540,78
138203134,2021-11-07T21:08:35.000Z,1.45745E+18,It?€?s not just that we made these promises before - look at how the infra bill is being messaged *now*I respect the President and the leg feat he just accomplished. But this is simply wrong. We did not fund the replacement of every child?€?s pipe &amp; we shouldn?€?t tell people we did https://t.co/3zpU20o6WR,1786,13452,1073,382
138203134,2021-11-07T20:50:43.000Z,1.45745E+18,I want to protect our party from the disappointment and collapse in turnout from communities like mine that occurs when we tell them we did things we didn?€?t do.We shouldn?€?t promise all lead pipes will be fixed if that is not the case. Some will most won?€?t. We must push for BBB,1103,9637,531,146
138203134,2021-11-07T20:44:10.000Z,1.45745E+18,The cost to replace every lead pipe in the United States is $45-60 billion.BIF only gives $15b. Without BBB many communities historically denied clean water will continue to be denied.Build Back Better has lead $ for disadvantaged communities. We must keep pushing for BBB.,6953,44659,2211,601
138203134,2021-11-07T20:29:59.000Z,1.45745E+18,The reason platitudes like this are insulting is bc they are exclusively employed to deny the working class poc and youth?€?s basic demands for livability. Like affordable rx drugsNo one says this to the safe-seat Dems who derailed climate action &amp; healthcare over a CBO table,1259,12043,447,45
138203134,2021-11-07T20:22:31.000Z,1.45744E+18,For people who say ?€?don?€?t let the perfect be the enemy of the good?€? to pass legislation consider why no one tells that to the Dems who killed passage of Rx drug pricing and Universal Pre-K this week over small process demands from safe Dem seats in places like NY and Hawaii.,3394,26339,1394,244
138203134,2021-11-07T16:30:27.000Z,1.45738E+18,If BBB isn?€?t delivered w/ BIF?€?s oil &amp; gas locked in we?€?re in trouble. That is what makes it a huge gamble.

138203134,2021-11-07T16:16:03.000Z,1.45738E+18,The desire to pass both together isn?€?t the unnuanced stance some pundits think it is.BIF has a lot of bad stuff in it - that?€?s how they got GOP votes. It ALSO has a lot of good stuff in it- what you?€?re hearing on TV.Passing BBB unlocks BIF?€?s climate goods so the good prevails,631,5368,214,40
138203134,2021-11-07T16:08:44.000Z,1.45738E+18,On the issue of climate think of BIF as a lock ???? and BBB as the key ???? Locks only open with keys. BIF climate benefits ONLY unlock with BBB?€?s ???? provisions.If we msg BIF as good on climate alone when it?€?s not we stop the pressure for BBB?€?s passage. Do not let this happen,2261,13504,1059,241
138203134,2021-11-07T15:52:47.000Z,1.45738E+18,On Mon/Tues we were set to pass both bills. The oil and gas lobby was working OVERTIME this week to kill the methane fees in BBB to ensure it didn?€?t pass with BIFSo for the sake of the planet and everyone younger than a baby boomer let?€?s pray that leadership delivers their IOU,724,5210,256,38
138203134,2021-11-07T15:49:48.000Z,1.45737E+18,2. Political - there were many many promises made to get to Friday?€?s passage. Promises from mod Dems House leadership and the President himself.If those promises do not get fulfilled it will make future passage of anything much more difficult. BIF will look like a cakewalk,341,3191,122,22
138203134,2021-11-07T15:41:09.000Z,1.45737E+18,The elevated stakes are not just policy but political.1. Policy- Passing BIF without BBB is a huge gamble. People will point to pro-climate investments in BIF but the oil &amp; gas giveaways wipe out its progress to 0 or risk worse emissions. Passing BBB unlocks BIF climate perks,323,2318,110,20
138203134,2021-11-07T15:30:50.000Z,1.45737E+18,Yes. BIF+BBB are not written as 2 distinct bills but interlocking policy. BIF?€?s climate benefits only unlock if BBB passes.If BBB gutted/dies we may have just locked in US emissions &amp;thrown away our biggest chance to combat climate change. Stakes are now higher on BBB passing https://t.co/nZUgX5yYsh,2222,11710,695,156

We need everyone.,897,13566,840,90
138203134,2021-11-05T16:06:14.000Z,1.45665E+18,Like the average audience for people seriously using the word ?€?woke?€? in a 2021 political discussion are James Carville and Fox News pundits so that should tell you all you need to know,1265,18881,737,156
138203134,2021-11-05T16:02:55.000Z,1.45665E+18,How can news outlets even attribute words to me I didn?€?t say?I said there are limits to trying to mobilize a campaign with a 100% moderate strategy without mobilizing the base.

138203134,2021-11-04T17:18:03.000Z,1.45631E+18,So for all the English-only pundits out there who want to wax ideological poetic about Latino polling numbers please understand that what?€?s happening now is way beyond a scale most English-only speakers can see.WaPo reported on it few days ago: https://t.co/GzFfOslUic,1444,6835,313,68
138203134,2021-11-04T17:13:41.000Z,1.45631E+18,I?€?ve said it before and I?€?m saying it again: Spanish-language misinformation campaigns are absolutely exploding on social media platforms like Facebook WhatsApp etc.It?€?s putting US English misinfo campaigns to shame. &amp; they aren?€?t getting disclaimers the way English posts do.,7718,37645,1665,650
138203134,2021-11-04T16:30:35.000Z,1.4563E+18,Anyways next time people say we don?€?t have money for basic services know it?€?s disingenuous.I would respect it (even if I disagreed) if those people were consistent but they are the same ones pushing military spending sprees and corporate giveaways every damn time. It?€?s gross,987,7515,266,44
138203134,2021-11-04T16:26:29.000Z,1.4563E+18,Last year in CARES alone the corporate bailout was a leveraged value of $4 TRILLION which is over 2x what we?€?re trying to invest in BBB over 10 years!I railed about it at the time and the right wing made a thing about it but I was pissed!

138203134,2021-11-04T16:02:00.000Z,1.45629E+18,I haven?€?t seen data yet if those anecdotes are indicative of a larger trend (&amp; if so how large) but the point still stands.Like many working class Latino familiesmy grandma lived with us growing up and cared for me as my parents worked. Until she moved in my mom stayed home,196,2047,86,14
138203134,2021-11-04T15:57:56.000Z,1.45629E+18,You can see this in the issue of wages.

138203134,2021-11-04T15:47:45.000Z,1.45629E+18,When people drop out of the workforce it?€?s a pretty complicated &amp; expensive endeavor to get them back.The reason is bc unlike physical supply chain issues where problems are a bit more straightforward (not saying easy but more clear) labor supply issues can be more complex.,244,2606,160,17
138203134,2021-11-04T15:42:43.000Z,1.45629E+18,Conservatives argue against raising wages by claiming it?€?ll raise prices.
