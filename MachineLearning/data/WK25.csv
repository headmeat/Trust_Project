50393960,2021-10-13T17:07:19.000Z,1.44833E+18,Still the disparities in access to the COVID-19 vaccine are shocking and unjust. Only 2 percent of people in low-income countries have received any COVID-19 vaccines. And the gap may be getting even larger as rich-world governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots.,150,1453,1,53
50393960,2021-10-13T17:07:18.000Z,1.44833E+18,Inequity in health is not new. Each year more than 5 million children?€?almost entirely in low- and middle-income countries?€?die before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases. Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundation?€?s top priority for more than 20 years.,314,2915,1,79
50393960,2021-10-12T16:58:40.000Z,1.44797E+18,The pandemic has worsened inequities. But it's also shown the world what's possible when we come together. Read why there's reason to be optimistic in our 2021 Goalkeepers Report. https://t.co/2XUNjdwCyf,193,1664,0,54

The Needle isn't the only approach. But you need some rigor not just to wing it.,16,660,18,4
16017475,2021-10-27T17:48:48.000Z,1.45342E+18,"The Needle with its optimism on Nov. 3 that Biden could win in Georgia in some ways broke the story that Biden was going to win in 2020 and was *way* ahead of the curve of other media coverage as was also the case for Trump's victory in 2016. So how have we ""moved beyond it?"". https://t.co/pySOX6KcVO",120,2468,64,33

16017475,2021-10-25T16:54:09.000Z,1.45268E+18,It's now 4 weeks into the World Series of Poker and fingers crossed but so far a good example of a vaccine requirement working.None of the events have been disrupted by COVID cases are still steady/declining in Clark Co. and anecdotally not hearing about many cases either.,63,1179,94,18
16017475,2021-10-10T08:24:59.000Z,1.44712E+18,So... ended up in 2nd place which somehow feels worse than 3rd place but *does* pay $152000. Congrats to my opponent John Monnette who played a great heads-up match and really earned the bracelet.,26,2878,82,16
16017475,2021-10-09T18:15:06.000Z,1.4469E+18,Made my first World Series of Poker final table!Tough lineup and I'm 6th/10 in chips so keeping expectations modest but very much looking forward to it. https://t.co/fsdo5Q5pCv,82,5247,152,28

16017475,2021-09-29T23:11:14.000Z,1.44335E+18,Spitting credit in states that have one senator from each party Democrats have senators representing 56% of the population and the GOP 44%. Just an incredibly different world if Senate control is 56-44 instead of 50-50.,167,1343,82,31
16017475,2021-09-29T23:00:16.000Z,1.44335E+18,I guess it's boring to talk about this but people tend to underrate Dems' degree of difficulty. When the Senate conveys such a large advantage to rural voters and one party does much better with those voters the other party is going to have trouble having a functional majority. https://t.co/3t8eN3naxZ,196,1353,96,60

16017475,2021-09-29T15:56:20.000Z,1.44324E+18,I still remember four years ago when Northam was ahead in polls but the CW was that Virginia was a tossup and then Northam won by like 9 points. https://t.co/lNZVuXyHUi,43,498,39,8

16017475,2021-09-28T14:06:26.000Z,1.44285E+18,I don't think it was a crazy concern either BTW. Kids are the largest group of unvaccinated people and the evidence on how well kids transmit under Delta is sort of all over the place. But should we be updating our priors? Yes I think at least a bit.,4,186,22,2
16017475,2021-09-28T14:04:00.000Z,1.44285E+18,Sure you're saying something. You might not be saying as much as if we had a time machine and could actually run counterfactual experiments. But people were worried about a surge caused by school reopenings large enough to drown out other trends and that hasn't happened. https://t.co/NBuBuFxBLH,16,261,19,1
16017475,2021-09-28T13:51:18.000Z,1.44285E+18,In the Northeast the numbers are relatively flat but that's partly because of a (probably school-related) increase in testing. In New Jersey for instance cases are down 8% over the past two weeks but tests are up 38%. Meanwhile NYC's positive test rate continues to decline. https://t.co/ml3LbWP1uG,28,325,26,3
16017475,2021-09-28T13:51:17.000Z,1.44285E+18,It doesn't preclude a winter surge later. But schools have been open long enough that it's looking somewhat unlikely we'll have a national COVID surge caused by school re-openings. Cases are still falling in most of the country.https://t.co/i8ElZQJZ5p https://t.co/wunbuvY1FN,232,1606,123,76

16017475,2021-09-23T16:59:20.000Z,1.44108E+18,Hope this is true but seems like a difficult modeling problem not least because there are all these different categories of immunity to deal with (vax possibly with different degrees of waning depending on the vaccine; natural; hybrid; vax w/ booster).https://t.co/AIqQidXmhy,22,260,58,5
16017475,2021-09-20T23:01:27.000Z,1.44009E+18,Given their structural disadvantages in the Senate I think you can argue Democrats are pretty lucky to have as many as 50 seats right now. Both GA races could easily have gone the other way NH in 2016 was *very* close strong D candidates held on in red WV OH MT in 2018. https://t.co/1IZPggsWwE,92,1170,79,33
16017475,2021-09-19T15:01:26.000Z,1.43961E+18,Biden's vax-or-test mandate is actually fairly popular. So is a vaccine requirement for indoor activities. Again not really a surprise when 75% of adults have taken at least one vaccine dose.https://t.co/XrpziRusRs https://t.co/vYanhFXAtT,525,2674,141,83
16017475,2021-09-18T20:50:39.000Z,1.43933E+18,The positivity rate in NYC is still headed down however.(Doesn't necessarily apply to all of the Northeast ?€? VT/NH/ME have had admirably few COVID cases relative to the rest of the country so far and so may have less natural immunity than say NY/NJ/CT/Eastern MA.) https://t.co/PQG4T3RrMi,13,89,17,0
16017475,2021-09-18T20:41:49.000Z,1.43933E+18,I'd think a lot of the testing surge in the Northeast has to do with schools and colleges reopening. In NYC for instance we see a big increase in testing rates in people under 25 years old while it's flat for other groups.https://t.co/2cHGUwgSaI https://t.co/3bMi42wj24 https://t.co/7mJfMOLUtE,17,246,22,2
16017475,2021-09-16T20:43:33.000Z,1.4386E+18,"Interesting. Folks have been confusing ""redistricting helps Republicans a lot relative to some nonpartisan baseline"" (true) and ""redistricting helps Republicans a lot relative to 2012-2020"" (not really because 2010 redistricting was also favorable for them). https://t.co/t8EFvhXZTX",67,720,34,9

16017475,2021-09-13T19:33:03.000Z,1.4375E+18,To bring this full circle some of the least robust evidence was in that Provincetown breakthrough study. Very preliminary in a highly non-representative setting and has since been somewhat refuted by more rigorous data. But P-Town occasioned a major shift in public guidance.,8,216,28,3
16017475,2021-09-13T19:24:52.000Z,1.4375E+18,There's also inconsistency re: breakthrough infections. Anti-booster folks say they don't matter much since severe outcomes are being prevented. OTOH a lot of public health messaging has implied breakthroughs do matter since they can potentially transmit to others.,8,198,27,4
16017475,2021-09-13T19:20:07.000Z,1.4375E+18,There is *not* robust evidence that vaccine boosters trade off with first doses elsewhere. It is a plausible theory lacking evidence.The data on waning immunity may not be as robust as we'd like but it's no less robust than the anti-booster arguments.https://t.co/Ez08IEhPRq,6,117,11,1
16017475,2021-09-13T19:20:06.000Z,1.4375E+18,"What I find frustrating about this (in agreement with Dr. Topol) is that it's *very* easy to move the bar for what constitutes ""robust evidence"". And there's been a lot of inconsistency about this with respect to boosters. https://t.co/MqnOjTr7pU",26,295,32,9
16017475,2021-09-13T18:17:33.000Z,1.43748E+18,This is not really a surprise. A supermajority of voters are vaccinated. There are a few conservatives who are pro-vaccine but not pro-vaccine-mandate but not very many (and more on Twitter than IRL). https://t.co/tAdqbKMAeX,97,966,71,9
16017475,2021-09-13T14:22:22.000Z,1.43742E+18,I want these experts to weigh in on the immunological benefits and risks of booster doses. That's where they're in a unique position to add insight. Instead we get a lot of everything else while e.g. the Israeli data is hand-waved away.,21,382,28,1
16017475,2021-09-13T14:10:00.000Z,1.43742E+18,"I am also not confident in these predictions about pop psychology (""may undermine confidence in primary vaccination"") as these have often been wrong throughout the pandemic (remember when some claimed the J&amp;J pause would *increase* confidence in the vaccines?). https://t.co/rv3uvHLqE4",17,362,25,1
16017475,2021-09-13T14:07:29.000Z,1.43742E+18,There's still very little evidence that the supply of vaccine doses is finite as opposed to being responsive to increased demand.https://t.co/HSrQYiFskb https://t.co/BOHrEVkL3i,78,858,78,26
16017475,2021-09-12T13:53:20.000Z,1.43705E+18,This is probably right (the COVID policies a regime chooses more or less reflect the preferences of its population) though there may also be a lot of catering to the loudest voices in the room who tend to be pro-restriction in liberal-dominated spaces/anti- in conservative ones. https://t.co/RTyF7s0VKl,23,423,47,7

16017475,2021-09-10T19:13:28.000Z,1.43641E+18,It probably won't be Andrew Yang but an unpopular Biden (or an unpopular Harris) running against Trump in 2024 would be relatively fruitful territory for a third-party presidential bid.,78,1232,506,113
16017475,2021-09-10T17:45:54.000Z,1.43639E+18,Maybe the CDC should have waited for this more robust data instead of declaring everything had changed because of Provincetown Bear Week. https://t.co/UazGOQkBXp,283,2660,159,32

So maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel if you have *very* high vax rates as New England does.",29,508,88,19
16017475,2021-09-10T14:52:14.000Z,1.43634E+18,And here are states where dining is up the most. A bit of a mixed bag. Mostly purple/red states that have had quite a few problems with Delta but also New England. https://t.co/9tDjZlSwc9,32,228,43,13

16017475,2021-09-10T02:46:59.000Z,1.43616E+18,This seems right. People have a lot of hot takes about the political impact.

16017475,2021-09-08T16:03:48.000Z,1.43563E+18,BTW part of the poor media messaging?€?see below?€?is in exaggerating how easily vaccinated people transmit. They're both much less likely to get COVID *and* less likely to transmit if they do. Being vaccinated offers unvaccinated household members (e.g. kids) a LOT of protection. https://t.co/SROuwRmxkD,185,1491,161,41
16017475,2021-09-08T15:39:57.000Z,1.43563E+18,If two-thirds of vaccinated infectious disease experts won't eat indoors at a restaurant and almost half won't attend an *outdoor* sporting event then of course people reading that are going to think breakthroughs are a big deal and of course they'll want boosters. https://t.co/iAn2WmxWiB,214,1688,646,315
16017475,2021-09-08T15:39:55.000Z,1.43563E+18,"OK but why are Americans fearful of breakthroughs?

16017475,2021-09-08T14:16:20.000Z,1.43561E+18,I've said before that I didn't think it was obvious that greater caution toward COVID would come to be the liberal position in the US. This is one reason why. People avoiding in-person contact tends to hurt the community services &amp; cultural amenities that liberals usually like. https://t.co/Q8S1s54tZB,60,651,102,16
16017475,2021-09-08T13:09:54.000Z,1.43559E+18,The vaccine companies were?€?unavoidably?€?doing a lot of educated guesswork with their dosing regimens. Which is why regulators ought to be relatively willing to adjust to new evidence rather than treating whatever protocols were chosen in clinical trials as the word of God. https://t.co/xIE6IRW45v,72,786,49,12
16017475,2021-09-08T12:37:24.000Z,1.43558E+18,In some ways I'm surprised that the higher end of the leisure-hospitality sector hasn't gotten more aggressive about implementing vaccine requirements purely as a revenue-maximizing strategy. I'd think there would be a market for vaccinated-only hotels or flights for instance.,90,1204,96,21
16017475,2021-09-08T12:25:01.000Z,1.43558E+18,Interesting that people who regularly attend NFL games say they're more likely to attend games with a vaccine requirement more so than in the population overall. I'd guess this partly reflects socioeconomic status (games are $$$; most high-income people are vaccinated). https://t.co/MN1uZ5Or36,116,1202,57,12
16017475,2021-09-07T20:02:25.000Z,1.43533E+18,One thing that's gotten lost in the panic over breakthrough infections is that vaccine entry requirements for mass gatherings (sporting events etc) as well as higher-risk indoor settings (gyms etc) are still a pretty reasonable way to manage the pandemic until cases come down.,221,3051,219,40
16017475,2021-09-07T15:43:43.000Z,1.43527E+18,Here's a convincing case that we should really be accelerating work and regulatory approval on Delta-specific vaccine updates even if the current vaccines work pretty well for *now*. https://t.co/rozAqxERbF,64,692,44,5
16017475,2021-09-07T12:40:34.000Z,1.43522E+18,So yeah if you're vaccinated and feel unwell?€?or have a close contact?€?stay home and get tested. But as a vaccinated person you probably don't need to live in fear of unknowingly asymptomatically spreading to others.,182,1969,118,19
16017475,2021-09-07T12:36:08.000Z,1.43522E+18,This seems like an underappreciated point: COVID spread by *asymptomatic* vaccinated people is probably very uncommon.https://t.co/qIOlRKGuKY https://t.co/6kVhh04uuh,1168,5748,242,148
16017475,2021-09-06T15:19:23.000Z,1.4349E+18,It's not the entire answer but COVID policy views are much more polarized along ideological lines in the US than elsewhere.In that sense I'm not sure the issue is misinformation so much as people making (sometimes costly and/or irrational) expressions of political identity. https://t.co/ZRpiF5eckr https://t.co/kc4sevUJOF,265,1327,243,92
16017475,2021-09-06T12:24:03.000Z,1.43485E+18,"It's partly because there's a puritanical streak in America's public health establishment and they were worried that people would (gasp!) begin seeing friends and family because of the ""false sense of security"" that tests provide.https://t.co/WOAdZO36Ii https://t.co/jOKYIyv7uT",82,1002,90,28

16017475,2021-09-03T15:27:45.000Z,1.43381E+18,Also why the White House is strongly pushing boosters. There's a good argument we don't need boosters yet because breakthrough infections are generally very mild and generally don't transmit that easily. Lots of vaccinated people aren't behaving like that though.,27,452,94,15

16017475,2021-08-12T00:50:05.000Z,1.42562E+18,A very popular but possibly dubious genre of COVID take is the one that asserts (or assumes implicitly) that the problems we've suffered from COVID were easily preventable.,176,1861,204,108
16017475,2021-08-11T19:22:48.000Z,1.42554E+18,Also:11. Some studies have small samples.12. If you're interested in Delta make sure you're not using pre-Delta data.13. There may be complicated statistical effects if people vary in the extent to which they're protected by the vaccines see e.g.:https://t.co/6bX66iUn7d,12,160,8,0
16017475,2021-08-11T18:27:42.000Z,1.42552E+18,Just off the cuff here are 10 things to think about when you read competing claims about vaccine effectiveness. Several of these can plausibly change the numbers quite a lot which is why it's not surprising that there's disagreement from study to study. https://t.co/Y5ceLEq0Ti,190,1149,77,30

16017475,2021-08-11T14:37:12.000Z,1.42547E+18,A final variation: maybe the CDC thought it needed to get a message out about Delta and but it assumed it would be tempered by the time the public heard it when instead e.g. the New York Times amplified all the scariest parts and played down conflicting evidence and caveats.,12,332,25,6
16017475,2021-08-11T14:32:12.000Z,1.42547E+18,Were they trying to make it seem like they had very robust evidence for their reversal on masks? Were they trying to get people's attention?Or say did the slides represent a minority/heterodox view within the CDC some individual who disagreed with the agency's take on Delta?,12,266,38,1
16017475,2021-08-11T14:29:26.000Z,1.42546E+18,I want to know more about the provenance of the leaked CDC document that *emphasized* the comparison to chickenpox and made a lot of other claims (e.g. about vaccinated transmission) that spun uncertain evidence about Delta in a very scary light.https://t.co/ohLXsxc7Ni,122,636,89,36
16017475,2021-08-11T13:59:23.000Z,1.42546E+18,Gesturing to the idea that we can't go back to lockdowns is probably a decent message (though the White House is saying the same thing). But on *specifics* the GOP often gets things very wrong. Tying the hands of local school boards is likely to be VERY unpopular for instance.,24,407,29,3
16017475,2021-08-11T13:53:59.000Z,1.42546E+18,Enthusiasm counts in midterms and maybe the minority is more vocal on some of these issues especially masks. But GOP messaging?€?in addition to often being somewhat incoherent from a public health standpoint?€?is also often out of line with public opinion.,24,361,20,3
16017475,2021-08-11T13:51:17.000Z,1.42545E+18,The thing about this is that vaccine mandates for adults are fairly popular (though not for children). Mask mandates are somewhat popular (and very popular in schools). The CDC is still decently popular.https://t.co/DCeJdh1xnc https://t.co/V883SISnPA,71,640,86,9

16017475,2021-08-10T19:12:07.000Z,1.42517E+18,If you think 1 House seat (actually more like 0.3 or 0.5 since Kind was neither sure to win nor is his replacement sure to lose) makes a huge difference in the Democrats' chances of retaining the House you're not doing the math right. The range of possible outcomes is very wide.,53,533,26,15
16017475,2021-08-10T17:37:22.000Z,1.42515E+18,This is different from vacancies from the Senate where appointees have a pretty weak re-election record. Gubernatorial replacements are elected officials who come up through the line of succession (usually as lieutenant governors) and have experience &amp; relationships.,6,182,4,0

16017475,2021-08-09T23:16:33.000Z,1.42487E+18,Lately I've seen people ask why the US numbers don't look more like the UK which had a surge in cases recently but comparatively few deaths. But US states that have vaccination rates ~similar to the UK actually have fewer deaths than the UK though the numbers lag &amp; may rise.,85,985,28,2
16017475,2021-08-09T22:42:21.000Z,1.42486E+18,Seeing a bigger gap in deaths than cases is exactly what you'd expect given how the vaccines work under Delta (pretty good against cases but VERY good against severe outcomes) but still interesting to see it in the data.,120,1559,33,2
16017475,2021-08-09T22:38:20.000Z,1.42486E+18,Over the past week the 10 least vaccinated states are averaging 3.0x per cases per capita than the 10 most vaccinated states 4.3x more hospitalizations per capita and 6.5x more deaths per capita.https://t.co/i8ElZQJZ5p,1485,4725,163,182
16017475,2021-08-09T21:35:24.000Z,1.42485E+18,IDK but I think a point that could be emphasized more in public health messaging (given how little testing the US is doing) is simply to encourage vaccinated people to get tested when they feel sick and stay home until they get a negative result.,19,302,24,3
16017475,2021-08-09T21:16:06.000Z,1.42484E+18,This is a good thread and makes a key point. If you *randomly* sample people vaccinated folks *do* seem to have lower viral loads. Otherwise you're getting a sample of people who self-select to be tested usually because they feel sick. https://t.co/Yi9FpbdzAx,147,1059,20,8
16017475,2021-08-09T17:36:55.000Z,1.42479E+18,OTOH a higher percentage of breakthrough cases have few/no symptoms so maybe people wouldn't seek out testing for those.Still the states with high vax uptake also tend to be doing more testing. E.g. MA has about 2x as much testing per capita as MO despite much less COVID.,10,266,25,1
16017475,2021-08-09T17:36:55.000Z,1.42479E+18,One useful piece of info would be how often people are getting tested by vaccination status. If you don't trust the medical system enough to be vaccinated you're probably not super inclined to get tested either.,38,763,42,3
16017475,2021-08-09T14:37:57.000Z,1.42474E+18,Can you do better by also accounting for other stuff like gender pre-existing conditions and access to health care? Sure. But age is very very very important in determining COVID fatality rates and looking at age-based survival estimates is surely useful as a first pass.,22,434,51,4

16017475,2021-08-09T14:09:04.000Z,1.42473E+18,Until recently the US was only doing about 1/3 as much testing as at our previous peak in the winter. It's since increased a bit but only to more like 1/2. You need to account for that when making inferences about death rates hospitalization rates etc.,6,190,19,0
16017475,2021-08-09T14:07:42.000Z,1.42473E+18,I'm not as optimistic as this re: the US peak but still an Interesting thread. A year-and-a-half into this thing and a lot of people still haven't figured out that you don't know much about COVID spread until you account for the amount of testing. https://t.co/b3oxNQ7IDM,16,218,21,3

138203134,2021-11-08T01:15:15.000Z,1.45752E+18,?€?Woke?€? is a term pundits are now using as a derogatory euphemism for civil rights &amp; justice.Making up a ?€?woke?€? problem results in putting civil &amp; voting rights on the backburner.

138203134,2021-11-08T01:02:39.000Z,1.45751E+18,One dangerous aspect of thinking there?€?s a ?€?woke problem?€? is that Dem chances for re-election or majorities in House Senate &amp; WH rely on the racial justice issue of voting rights.Dems distancing from racial justice makes protection of voting rights less likelyensuring losses,4550,33634,3486,677

It ALSO has a lot of good stuff in it- what you?€?re hearing on TV.Passing BBB unlocks BIF?€?s climate goods so the good prevails,631,5368,214,40

138203134,2021-11-07T15:41:09.000Z,1.45737E+18,The elevated stakes are not just policy but political.1. Policy- Passing BIF without BBB is a huge gamble. People will point to pro-climate investments in BIF but the oil &amp; gas giveaways wipe out its progress to 0 or risk worse emissions. Passing BBB unlocks BIF climate perks,323,2318,110,20
138203134,2021-11-07T15:30:50.000Z,1.45737E+18,Yes. BIF+BBB are not written as 2 distinct bills but interlocking policy. BIF?€?s climate benefits only unlock if BBB passes.If BBB gutted/dies we may have just locked in US emissions &amp;thrown away our biggest chance to combat climate change.

138203134,2021-11-04T15:57:56.000Z,1.45629E+18,You can see this in the issue of wages.
